# funnel
Rendering a funnel with D3.js

## What it does

It creates a graphical representation of a funnel with multiple phases. Each phase is dimensioned by the number of elements in it.

The entries are ordered as a tag cloud... you can specify the size, the largest element will be the base of the cloud.

Each entry also specifies an URL and if you click on the word in the tagcloud, it opens the link in another window/tab.

## Current version

Well this is kind of completely new, I tested with some test data... so probably you will come up with a case that I have not tested. If you have trouble, feel free to launch an issue with some detailed data and how it should look (or even better : send me a pull request)

## Demo

Have a look at [this jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/kullervo16/s92bv7w7/) for an example and a quick display of how it works.
